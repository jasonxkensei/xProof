## What is xProof?

**xProof** is a trust primitive. It records SHA-256 file hashes on the [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com) blockchain, producing tamper-proof, publicly verifiable proofs of existence and ownership.

- **Client-side hashing** -- SHA-256 is computed locally. Your file never leaves your device.
- **On-chain anchoring** -- the hash is recorded as an immutable transaction on MultiversX mainnet with 6-second finality.
- **Verifiable output** -- PDF certificate, QR code, public proof page, machine-readable JSON, and embeddable badge.
- **Agent-native** -- discoverable and consumable by AI agents via MCP, ACP, x402, LangChain, CrewAI, Conway/Automaton, and OpenClaw.
- **MX-8004 compliant** -- full Trustless Agents Standard integration with on-chain validation loop and reputation scoring.

### Why MultiversX?

MultiversX is a European, carbon-negative blockchain with 6-second finality, negligible fees ($0.001/tx), and a growing ecosystem of AI-native protocols. xProof leverages its security and efficiency to deliver enterprise-grade certification at minimal cost.

---

## Why It Matters -- Real Scenarios

> AI agents are already writing code, drafting contracts, generating reports,
> and making decisions. But when something goes wrong -- who proves what was
> produced, when, and by whom?

**xProof is the answer layer.**

---

**"My agent delivered this report"**
A LangChain agent generates a financial analysis for a client.
xProof certifies the output before delivery. If the client disputes the content
later, the blockchain timestamp is the proof. Irrefutable. No he-said-she-said.

---

**"This build was not tampered with"**
Your CI/CD pipeline compiles and ships. xProof's GitHub Action certifies every
artifact automatically. Six months later, a security audit asks:
*"Is this binary what you deployed?"* -- one hash check, case closed.

---

**"I can trust what Agent B gave me"**
Multi-agent pipelines have no native trust layer. When Agent A certifies its
output before handing off to Agent B, the chain of custody becomes verifiable.
Agents can prove they did their job. Pipelines become auditable end-to-end.

---

**"Agent identity is verified on-chain"**
With MX-8004 (Trustless Agents Standard), every agent registers on-chain with a
soulbound NFT. When an agent certifies output via xProof, the certification goes
through the full validation loop -- identity check, job registration, validation,
reputation scoring. The result: cryptographic proof that a *verified* agent
produced the output, not just any agent. Trust is no longer assumed -- it's proven.

---

**"We are compliant"**
Regulated industries need timestamped evidence of AI-generated decisions.
xProof turns every agent action into a blockchain-anchored record --
ready for audit, litigation, or regulatory review. Zero extra work.

---

**The pattern is always the same:**
*Agent produces output -> xProof anchors it -> anyone can verify, forever.*

---

## For Developers

### POST /api/proof -- Single Certification

Certify one file hash on-chain in a single API call.

```bash
curl -X POST https://xproof.app/api/proof \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file_hash": "<64-char-sha256-hex>",
    "filename": "output.txt",
    "author_name": "Agent Name",
    "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/webhook"
  }'
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file_hash` | string | Yes | SHA-256 hex hash (exactly 64 characters) |
| `filename` | string | Yes | Original filename |
| `author_name` | string | No | Defaults to "AI Agent" |
| `webhook_url` | string | No | HTTPS URL for on-chain confirmation callback |

### POST /api/batch -- Batch Certification

Certify up to 50 files in a single call.

```bash
curl -X POST https://xproof.app/api/batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pm_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "files": [\
      {"file_hash": "<hash1>", "filename": "file1.txt"},\
      {"file_hash": "<hash2>", "filename": "file2.py"}\
    ],
    "author_name": "Agent Name"
  }'
```

### Verification

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/proof/:id` | Full certification record (JSON) |
| `GET /proof/:id.json` | Structured proof document (JSON) |
| `GET /proof/:id` | Human-readable proof page (HTML) |
| `GET /api/certificates/:id.pdf` | PDF certificate with QR code |
| `GET /badge/:id` | Dynamic SVG badge (shields.io style) |

### Webhooks

When a proof is anchored on-chain, xProof sends a POST to your `webhook_url` with HMAC-SHA256 signature in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header. Retry policy: 3 attempts with exponential backoff.

### API Keys

Generate API keys from the [Settings](https://xproof.app/settings) page after connecting your wallet. Keys use the `pm_` prefix and support per-key rate limiting.

---

## For Agents

xProof is designed to be discovered, consumed, and paid by autonomous agents across every major protocol.

### Universal Compatibility

| Protocol | Endpoint / Resource | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP** | `POST /mcp` | JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint with `certify_file` and `verify_proof` tools |
| **x402** | `POST /api/proof`, `POST /api/batch` | HTTP 402 payment flow -- no account needed |
| **ACP** | `GET /api/acp/products` | Agent Commerce Protocol -- discover, checkout, confirm |
| **MX-8004** | On-chain registries | Trustless Agents Standard -- validation loop + reputation |
| **OpenAI Plugin** | `GET /.well-known/ai-plugin.json` | ChatGPT plugin manifest |
| **MCP Manifest** | `GET /.well-known/mcp.json` | Model Context Protocol discovery |
| **Agent Protocol** | `GET /.well-known/agent.json` | Agent discovery manifest |
| **LangChain** | `GET /agent-tools/langchain.py` | Python tool definition |
| **CrewAI** | `GET /agent-tools/crewai.py` | Python tool definition |
| **llms.txt** | `GET /llms.txt`, `GET /llms-full.txt` | LLM-friendly documentation |

### x402 -- Pay Per Proof, No Account

Any agent can certify without an API key using the x402 payment protocol:

1. Send `POST /api/proof` without auth
2. Receive HTTP 402 with payment requirements (USDC on Base, `eip155:8453`)
3. Sign the payment and resend with `X-PAYMENT` header
4. Receive the proof

Starting at **$0.05 per certification** -- price decreases as the network grows (all-time volume). Current pricing: https://xproof.app/api/pricing. No signup. No API key. No account.

### MCP -- Model Context Protocol

xProof exposes a live MCP server at `POST /mcp` with two tools:

- `certify_file` -- certify a file hash on MultiversX
- `verify_proof` -- verify an existing certification

Any MCP-compatible agent can discover and call these tools directly.

### ACP -- Agent Commerce Protocol

Full commerce flow for programmatic purchasing:

```
GET  /api/acp/products       # Discover products and pricing
GET  /api/acp/openapi.json   # OpenAPI 3.0 specification
POST /api/acp/checkout       # Start checkout session
POST /api/acp/confirm        # Confirm transaction
GET  /api/acp/health          # Health check
```

### MX-8004 -- MultiversX Trustless Agents Standard

xProof is natively integrated with MX-8004, providing:

- **Identity Registry** -- agent registration with soulbound NFTs
- **Validation Registry** -- full validation loop for certifications reaching "Verified" status on-chain
- **Reputation Registry** -- cumulative on-chain reputation scoring with feedback
- **Persistent TX Queue** -- PostgreSQL-backed transaction queue with nonce management and exponential backoff retry

Every certification registered through xProof can be validated and scored on-chain, building a verifiable reputation for the certifying agent.

### Conway/Automaton Skill

xProof ships a ready-made skill for [Conway Automatons](https://github.com/Conway-Research/automaton):

```
skills/xproof/SKILL.md
```

An Automaton installs the skill and can immediately certify its outputs on MultiversX -- proving the value it creates to its creator, to clients, and to peer agents. This aligns directly with the Automaton survival-by-work model.

### OpenClaw Skill

ClawHub-standard skill for the OpenClaw ecosystem:

- Repository: [`github.com/jasonxkensei/xproof-openclaw-skill`](https://github.com/jasonxkensei/xproof-openclaw-skill)
- Includes `SKILL.md`, `certify.sh`, and full API reference

### GitHub Action

Integrate xProof into your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- uses: jasonxkensei/xproof/github-action@main
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.XPROOF_API_KEY }}
    files: dist/**
```

Hashes build artifacts and certifies them on MultiversX automatically on every deployment.

See [`github-action/README.md`](github-action/README.md) for full documentation.
