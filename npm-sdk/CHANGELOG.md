# Changelog

All notable changes to `@xproof/xproof` will be documented here.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Timing Breakdown** — `certifyWithConfidence()` now accepts an optional
  `confidence.timing` field of type `TimingBreakdown` to anchor the full
  decision chronology on-chain:
  - `instructionReceivedAt` — ISO8601 timestamp when the instruction arrived
  - `reasoningStartedAt` — ISO8601 timestamp when reasoning began
  - `actionTakenAt` — ISO8601 timestamp when the action was executed
  - `jurisdictionType` — accountability classification
    (`"instruction_following"` | `"autonomous_inference"` | `"human_approved"`)
  - `reasoningDurationMs` / `totalDurationMs` — computed by the server,
    present in API responses only
- **`TimingBreakdown` interface** — new exported type (camelCase)
- **`JurisdictionType` union type** — exported for static typing
- **`JURISDICTION_TYPES` const** — exported readonly array for runtime
  validation (`["instruction_following", "autonomous_inference", "human_approved"]`)
- **`Certification.timingBreakdown?`** — response field populated by the
  server when timing data is present (deserialised from snake_case)

### Changed

- `ConfidenceOptions` extended with optional `timing?: TimingBreakdown`
- `User-Agent` header updated to `xproof-js/0.1.8`

### How to upgrade

No breaking changes. All new fields are optional.

npm install @xproof/xproof@0.1.8
