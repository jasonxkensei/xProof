"""AutoGen + xProof: Timing Breakdown example.

Shows how to certify AutoGen agent messages with a full decision chronology.
The timing breakdown captures:
  - instruction_received_at  — when the user sent the message
  - reasoning_started_at     — when the agent processed it
  - action_taken_at          — when the agent's reply was sent

For messages the agent inferred on its own, use ``autonomous_inference``
as the jurisdiction_type instead of ``instruction_following``.

Run: python timing_breakdown.py
