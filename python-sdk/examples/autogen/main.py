"""AutoGen + xProof: automatic message certification between agents.

Demonstrates how to attach xProof hooks to AutoGen agents so that every
message exchanged is certified on-chain with 4W metadata (WHO, WHAT,
WHEN, WHY) on MultiversX.

Run: python main.py

Requirements:
    pip install pyautogen xproof

This demo simulates two agents exchanging messages with xProof hooks
attached, certifying each message on-chain.  It uses mock objects for
the xProof client so no real API key or LLM backend is required.
