  "tagline": "Anchor agent outputs on MultiversX — verifiable by any agent or human",
  "description": "xProof is a proof primitive that lets AI agents sign and anchor their outputs on the MultiversX blockchain. Once anchored, any agent or human can verify the output's integrity, timestamp, and origin — trustlessly. Use xProof when your agent produces something that matters: a decision, a report, a transaction, a generated file. Supports single file, batch (up to 50), x402 payment (no account needed), and MCP integration. Every certification builds on-chain reputation via the MX-8004 standard.",
